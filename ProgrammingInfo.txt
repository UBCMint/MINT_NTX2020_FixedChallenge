Need to install MPLab software.


Found some sample code we can use to implement SPI on the PIC32MX470: 
https://www.microchip.com/forums/m929006.aspx, 
http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/PIC32MX:_SPI_Communication_between_PIC32s

and section 10.1.2 in this datasheet: 
https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1299.pdf sets up the ADS1299 for basic functions

An examples project shows code to write in MPLab for the PIC:

Structure of code for PIC:
void main(void)
{
   // Initialise everything
    while(1)
    {
        // Do the repetitive work
    }
// You should never get here
}
