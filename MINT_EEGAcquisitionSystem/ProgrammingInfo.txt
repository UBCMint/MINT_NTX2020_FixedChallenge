Found some sample code we can use to implement SPI on the PIC32MX470: https://www.microchip.com/forums/m929006.aspx, http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/PIC32MX:_SPI_Communication_between_PIC32s

and section 10.1.2 in this datasheet: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1299.pdf sets up the ADS1299 for basic functions
