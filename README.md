# MINT EEG Acquisition System: JellyFish 1.0

### Background
There are many commercially available EEG headsets such as MUSE, OpenBCI, Neurosky, and Emotiv. However, they have too high price, not enough electrodes for high EEG spatial-resolution, low signal quality, or too much time to set up. Over the last two years, MINT has mainly focused on the EEG board only. This year, we will integrate the EEG board into a complete EEG headset that is comfortable, adjustable, sturdy to be worn anytime and anywhere at a reasonable price so that EEG headset can become a common household device as a computer mouse.

## About Us

Mentha was created by [(Multifaceted Innovation in NeuroTechnology](https://ubcmint.github.io/) (MINT), an undergraduate neurotech team, part of the group [Biomedical Engineering Student Team](http://www.ubcbest.com/) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

JellyFish 1.0 was submitted as a project for the Fixed Challenge category of the [NeuroTechX 2020 Student Club competition](https://neurotechx.github.io/studentclubs/competition/).
