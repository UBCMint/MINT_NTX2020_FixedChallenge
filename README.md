# MINT EEG Acquisition System: JellyFish 1.0

## Background
There are many commercially available EEG headsets such as MUSE, OpenBCI, Neurosky, and Emotiv. However, they have too high price, not enough electrodes for high EEG spatial-resolution, low signal quality, or too much time to set up. Over the last two years, MINT has mainly focused on the EEG board only. This year, we will integrate the EEG board into a complete EEG headset that is comfortable, adjustable, sturdy to be worn anytime and anywhere at a reasonable price so that EEG headset can become a common household device as a computer mouse.


## Overall Design

## Electrode
The wet electrode consists of a piece of cotton sandwich between the scalp and the pre-amplifier PCB board that acts as a bridge when saturated with the electrode solution. Active electrodes with pre-amplifiers allow for the signal acquired to be immediately boosted before additional noise is incorporated into the signal during the travel between the electrode and the system. The signal can be further increased by a screw on top of the electrode that increases the pressure between the cotton and the scalp when twisted. Handles on the sides of the electrode allows for the component to be mounted and slide on the headset frame for maximum flexibility.

Below is the rough breakdown of costs, for those who want to replicate this design:

## About Us

JellyFish 1.0 was created by [(Multifaceted Innovation in NeuroTechnology](https://ubcmint.github.io/) (MINT), an undergraduate neurotech team, part of the group [Biomedical Engineering Student Team](http://www.ubcbest.com/) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

JellyFish 1.0 was submitted as a project for the Fixed Challenge category of the [NeuroTechX 2020 Student Club competition](https://neurotechx.github.io/studentclubs/competition/).
